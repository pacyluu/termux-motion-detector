# termux-motion-detector

This project is a lightweight motion-detection utility designed to run directly on Android via Termux. It continuously compares images over time and uses a pixel-difference heuristic to determine when meaningful change has occurred. When the motion score exceeds a configurable threshold, the app records triggers a Discord notification via Webhooks

I use this detect when my cats come to the door after being outside.
